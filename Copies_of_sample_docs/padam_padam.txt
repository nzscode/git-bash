(Padam) You look like fun to me
(Padam) You look a little like somebody I know
(Padam) And I can tell you how this ends
(Padam) I'll be in your head all weekend
(Padam) Shivers and butterflies
(Padam) I get the shivers when I look into your eyes
(Padam) And I can tell that you're all in
(Padam) 'Cause I can hear your heart beatin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Padam (Padam)

[Chorus]
Padam, padam, I hear it and I know
Padam, padam, I know you wanna take me home
Padam, and get to know me close
Padam, padam, when your heart goes
Padam, padam, I hear it and I know
Padam, padam, I know you wanna take me home
Padam, and take off all my clothes
Padam, padam, when your h–µart goes "padam"
